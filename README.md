This repository contains the notebooks, data, and resulting figures used for understanding and analysing option for flood risk management strategies on the IJssel River.

The workflow for this analysis contains the following approaches:
1. Open exploration (PF1)
2. Robust Decision-making (PF1 and PF3)
3. Multi-scenario Robust Decision-making (PF1)
4. Multi-scenario Robust Decision-making (PF3)

The methodology and analysis for each of these approaches are outlined in the .ipynb notebooks with corresponding numbers.

This repository also includes a final report with a more detailed interpretation of our results.
